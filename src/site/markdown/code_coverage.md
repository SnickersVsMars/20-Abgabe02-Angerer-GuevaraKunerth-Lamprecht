#Code Coverage
Code coverage (or test coverage) is a measure used to describe the degree 
to which the source code of a program is executed while running test cases. 
A program with high code coverage has had more of its source code executed 
during testing. As a result of that, the program has a lower chance of 
containing undetected bugs compared to a program with low code coverage.

While a code coverage of 100% is not always possible or even recommended, 
this project has reached it. The complete coverage was reached, due to the 
small project size, and a rather low degree of code complexity.

# Software Configuration Management #

## Exercise02: Maven ###

Team members:
* [Martin Guevara-Kunerth](https://github.com/martin-gk)
* [Michael Lamprecht](https://github.com/lammia07)
* [Samuel Angerer](https://github.com/SamBrix)

The second exercise is about building and implementing a project in a team and testing it. 
For our build process we will use Maven, the tests will be written with JUnit 5 
and a Maven Site Documentation will be created. 
We will manage our source code with git over github and develop with the 
help of IntelliJ IDEA.
